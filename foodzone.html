                A good food website design don’t need to be ornamental— it can be simple and straightforward in order to
                let the food photography shine. It’s not that branding isn’t important, it’s just that it’s best
                communicated through colors and logos.

            <h3>VEGETABLES</h3>
            <p>Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and
                filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace
                elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E.</p>
